# ``Stubbles``

Stubbles is a declarative HTTP stubbing library written in Swift, with support for iOS, tvOS, watchOS and macOS.

## Installation

Stubbles is available via the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) which is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system and automates the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Stubbles as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/aplr/Stubbles.git",
        .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1")
    )
]
```

## Quick Start

This section provides you with a brief introduction on how ``Stubbles`` works and how you can use it to test your network requests.

### Intercepting requests

Stubbles works by intercepting every request made by your application. To start intercepting requests, call ``Stubbles/Stubbles/start()`` on Stubble's ``Stubbles/Stubbles/shared`` instance. If you want to stop intercepting requests, just call ``Stubbles/Stubbles/stop()``.

```swift
// Start intercepting requests
Stubbles.shared.start()

// - Register stubs ...
// - Run network requests ...
// - Run assertions ...

// Stop intercepting requests
Stubbles.shared.stop()
```

> Note: Stubbles exchanges the implementation of `URLSessionConfiguration.protocolClasses` during runtime, which is rather invasive. Make sure to include ``Stubbles`` only in your test targets and not submit it to the App Store, it *could* make reviewers angry.

### Registering stubs

After a request was intercepted, Stubbles tries to match it with every registered ``StubRequest`` by comparing their URL, method, headers and body. If a request was found, it uses it to build a mock response. Otherwise, it sends an empty response with status `200 OK` by default.

To declare and register a `StubRequest` at once, you can use ``Stubbles/Stubbles/stub(_:)``, which allows you to declaratively define a ``StubRequest`` which is automatically registered. It is the same as creating a ``StubRequest`` manually and registering it with ``Stubbles/Stubbles/register(stub:)``.

The example below registers a ``StubRequest`` which matches a `GET` request on `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`. `Stubbles` responds with a `200 OK` and the given `Todo`.

```swift
let stubRequest = Stubbles.shared.stub {
    Endpoint("http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
    StubResponse {
        StatusCode(200)
        JsonBody(Todo(id: 1, title: "Write Stubbles doc", completed: false))
    }
}
```

### Running network requests

Having set up the stubs, it is now time to run a network request. You can use any networking library as you like, as all of them make use of `UrlSessionConfiguration`, which we are intercepting.

### Running assertions

Each time a ``StubRequest`` is matched, a ``StubRequest/Call`` is filed, containing the underlying `URLRequest`. All calls are available on ``StubRequest/calls``, which you can use for assertions.

The code example below checks if the `stubRequest` we defined before was matched exactly once.

```swift
XCTAssertEqual(stubRequest.calls.count, 1, "Expected request to be sent exactly once.")
```

### Putting it all together

Having discussed all steps in detail, we can now have a look at the big picture. Usually, you will use `Stubbles` within your `XCTest` suite. To make sure requests are intercepted before running a test, call ``Stubbles/Stubbles/start()`` in the `setUp` function.

In order to reset all stubs and stop intercepting requests, put the call to ``Stubbles/Stubbles/stop()`` into the `tearDown` function.

You can find a simple test case in the code example down below. The `TodoApi.getTodo(id:)` does a simple network call using `UrlSession.shared.data(from:)` and returns the decoded `Todo`.

```swift
class ApiTest: XCTestCase {

    override func setUp() {
        // Register request interceptor
        Stubbles.shared.start()
        super.setUp()
    }

    override func tearDown() {
        // Unregister request interceptor
        Stubbles.shared.stop()
        super.tearDown()
    }
    
    func testGetTodo() async throws {
        // Arrange
        let todoApi = TodoApi()

        let expectedTodo = Todo(id: 1, title: "todo", completed: false)
        
        let stubRequest = Stubbles.shared.stub {
            Endpoint("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
            StubResponse {
                StatusCode(200)
                JsonBody(expectedTodo)
            }
        }
        
        // Act
        let actualTodo = try await todoApi.getTodo(id: 1)
        
        // Assert
        XCTAssertEqual(expectedTodo, actualTodo)
        XCTAssertEqual(stubRequest.calls.count, 1, "Expected request to be sent exactly once.")
    }

}
```
