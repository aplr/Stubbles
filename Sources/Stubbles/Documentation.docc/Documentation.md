## Overview

ðŸš§ WIP

## Installation

CodeKit is available via the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) which is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system and automates the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding CodeKit as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/aplr/CodeKit.git",
        .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1")
    )
]
```
